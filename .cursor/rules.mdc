These should be respected ALWAYS:
1. Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.
2. IMPROVEMENTS and FURTHER PROGRESSIONS:
- S1: Suggest ways to improve code stability or scalability.
- S2: Offer strategies to enhance performance or security.
- S3: Recommend methods for improving readability or maintainability.
- Recommend areas for further investigation

-> always make sure to only execute code & install requirements in the conda environment (bnb_data4transformation) and not in the base environment.
